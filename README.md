**Insights and Results**
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a JSON syntax errror for this project. I spent a couple of days trying to understand the issue and used Google as a source. I wasn't able to produce an answer and decided to restart the whole project on a different repository. I still ran into the same issue and decided to email classmates. The issue was easily solve. I was missing [] in the JSON file, which in turn showed a syntax error. Before being able to fix the JSON file issue, I decided to comment out some of the JavaScript. This was when I found out I had not install express-validator. I was getting a long lsit of errors in the terminal and had to single each one out. I had also spent a lot of time styling this project. I had issues where the margin and text were getting confused with each other. Using Bootstrap could've saved me a lot of time.
